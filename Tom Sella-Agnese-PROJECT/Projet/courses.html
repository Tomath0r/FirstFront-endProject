                    This course allows me to present you this website today. This is the best course I ever had in my entier life :)
                    <article id="scroll_test2">
                    Seriously, in this course we learn computer langauges html, css and javascipt. This knowledge allows us to build a web page
                    such as the one youre actually on.

                    <article >
                    Usually, I don't really like computer science. I already learned C, C++ and java back in Paris and I didn't enjoyed most of them.
                    With html and css it's different because I see the result of what I do instansly. This is a way more fun language !

                The precise name of this course is Analog Circuit Design and Comms. I've studied it for two years in Paris.
                <article>
                That's not my favourite course but sometimes we study things that are really interesting. 
                Undertanding how electronical objects that surround us work can be fun.
                </article>
                <article id="scroll_test3">
                Basically, we study how circuits are made, what is the purpose of ervery componant, how it is made, etc ...
                I also have practical courses, I actually have to go to school to attend this course and that's a really good news !

                    The third and final course I have this semester is Computer Systems and Networks.
                <article>
                    This is actually the first time I study this ! I think I enjoy it, 
                    understanding how connected objets communicate between each other is quite interesting.

                <article id="scroll_test4">
                    Almost every weaks, I have to submit a work that the teacher asks us to do. It is mostely pratical questions
                    that I have to do on my computer. 
                    Actually, I also have courses at the school every week on Mondays, I enjoy it a lot.
